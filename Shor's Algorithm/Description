Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm (an algorithm which runs on a quantum computer) for integer factorization formulated by 
Peter Shor in 1994. Integer factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into smaller integers that, when multiplied, 
give the original number. This is a problem that is thought to be hard for classical computers, especially as the size of numbers grows.

Shor's algorithm, however, can solve this problem exponentially faster than the best known algorithm for a classical computer. 
This speedup has significant implications, especially for the field of cryptography, because many popular cryptographic algorithms 
(like RSA) rely on the fact that factorizing large numbers is computationally difficult for classical computers.

Here's a high-level overview of how Shor's algorithm works:

Random selection: The algorithm begins by choosing a random number less than the number to be factored (let's call it N).

Check if coprime: Check if this number is coprime with N (their greatest common divisor is 1). If it's not, we've found a 
factor and we can stop here. If it is, we continue with this number (let's call it x).

Period finding: The key to Shor's algorithm is in finding the period of the function f(a) = x^a mod N, which is a periodic function. 
Here is where quantum mechanics comes in: we initialize a quantum system in a superposition of states, each representing a different 
number a, and then use a quantum Fourier transform to find the period of the function.

Factor finding: Once we have found the period (let's call it r), we can compute the factors of N as the greatest common divisor of N 
and both x^(r/2) + 1 and x^(r/2) - 1. If r is odd or if x^(r/2) is a multiple of N, then this step will fail and we have to start again 
with a new random x.

Step 3 is the crux of the algorithm where the quantum Fourier transform, a key operation in many quantum algorithms, is used. 
It's important to note that while Shor's algorithm is theoretically very powerful, implementing it on a physical quantum computer 
is still a significant challenge due to issues like quantum decoherence and the limited number of qubits available on current machines.
