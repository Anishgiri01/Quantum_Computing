Here's a a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the ground state energy of a helium atom in Fortran.

In this code, parameters z and b are varied to generate a plot of ground state energy of Helium as a function of z and b. An output file
if generated (attached in the repo). To plot the graph, a python code is used.
